Werewolf Rampage is a two player game where you play as a person afflicted with lycanthropy. The first player plays as the human side of the person, and must hide a key in a piece of furniture. After time runs out they will turn into a werewolf and player two will take the controller. If they find the key in the allotted time limit they will escape and eat people, meaning player one looses.

Player 1 controls:
Use the p2 joystick to move around and the fire button to secretly hide a key when standing on top of furniture
You can end your turn early by pressing the fire button again after hiding the key
Hand the controller to player 2 when you transform


Player 2 controls:
Use the p2 joystick to move around and the fire button to search for a key when standing on top of furniture
Press any key on the keyboard to continue to the next game
