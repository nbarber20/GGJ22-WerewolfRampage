Werewolf Rampage is a two player game where you play as a person afflicted with lycanthropy. The first player plays as the human side of the person, and must hide a key in a piece of furniture. After time runs out they will turn into a werewolf and player two will take the controller. If they find the key in the allotted time limit they will escape and eat people, meaning player one looses.
